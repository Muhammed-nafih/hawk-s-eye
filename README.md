This project seeks to address the critical need for advanced home security by leveraging modern face recognition technology. the solution aims to identify and differentiate individuals approaching a residence. The primary goal is to enhance homeowner control through pre-registration of authorized visitors, ensuring seamless access while triggering alerts for unrecognized individuals. Additionally, the project extends its impact by assisting law enforcement in identifying potential thieves, fostering collaboration between home security and authorities to deter criminals and expedite suspect apprehension, ultimately contributing to safer communities.
We integrates face recognition technology into existing CCTV setups. We used OpenCV for capturing camera feeds and the Face Recognition library for identifying and comparing faces.
